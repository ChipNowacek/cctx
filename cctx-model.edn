  1. *That is a lot of changes to the builder.* Half the file is showing up in the diff. To my mind, that amount of change argues for new.
  2. The biggest template file is `cctx.clj` which isn't valid Clojure.
  3. I tried all sorts of `--classpath` to get `bb` to work: 
             - `bb.edn`
             - All sorts of `--classpath` settings
             - Changes to `deps.edn`
  I just couln't get it to work. You tried a bunch of things. Regardless, I think we're out of Babashka's sweet spot. A real builder ought to be built anyway. Being able to use a REPL would be helpful — and you need valid code to do that.
             
  Would you please *try* to set us up anew in 'src'? Since I'm new to this `defprotocol`, `deftype`, and `defmulti` stuff, I'd need to learn from your sample. Do we in fact need a `cctx.clj` template in this architecture?
             
  Thoughts? Questions? Concerns?"
 :response-md "You're absolutely right. Let's start fresh with a proper Clojure project structure. I'll create a new setup in the 'src' directory, focusing on making everything valid Clojure code and providing a clear example of using `defprotocol`, `deftype`, and `defmulti`.

Here's the proposed structure and implementation:

1. Create a new project structure
2. Implement a core namespace with the main CCTX logic
3. Create a simple transactor example
4. Update the template structure

Step-by-step solution:

1. Create new project structure:

### [deps.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/deps.edn)

```clojure
{:paths [\"src\"]
 :deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version \"1.11.1\"}
        metosin/malli {:mvn/version \"0.10.1\"}}}
```

2. Implement core CCTX logic:

### [core.clj](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/src/cctx/core.clj)

```clojure


Made changes.

(ns cctx.core
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]
            [clojure.edn :as edn]
            [malli.core :as m]))

(defprotocol CCTXTransactor
  (validate [this context] \"Validate the transaction\")
  (transact! [this context] \"Execute the transaction\")
  (rollback! [this context] \"Rollback the transaction\"))

(defmulti create-transactor :type)

(defn load-cctx-spec [file-path]
  (let [spec (-> file-path io/file slurp edn/read-string)]
    ; Here you would validate the spec
    spec))

(defn create-cctx! [spec-file]
  (let [spec (load-cctx-spec spec-file)
        transactor (create-transactor spec)]
    (when (validate transactor {:spec spec})
      (transact! transactor {:spec spec}))))

; Other core functions like activate-cctx!, deactivate-cctx!, etc. would go here
```

3. Create a simple transactor example:

### [no_op.clj](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/src/cctx/transactors/no_op.clj)

```clojure


Made changes.

(ns cctx.transactors.no-op
  (:require [cctx.core :as core]))

(deftype NoOpTransactor [spec]
  core/CCTXTransactor
  (validate [_ context]
    (println \"Validating NoOp transaction\")
    true)
  
  (transact! [_ context]
    (println \"Executing NoOp transaction\")
    {:status :success})
  
  (rollback! [_ context]
    (println \"Rolling back NoOp transaction\")
    {:status :success}))

(defmethod core/create-transactor :no-op
  [spec]
  (->NoOpTransactor spec))
```

4. Update the template structure:

### [no_op.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/resources/templates/v2/no_op.edn)

```clojure


Made changes.

{:type :no-op
 :title \"No Operation\"
 :description \"This change does nothing\"
 :changes [{:id :do-nothing
            :type :no-op
            :description \"Absolutely nothing happens\"}]
 :requires []
 :rollback true
 :dry-run true}
```

In this new structure, we don't need a separate `cctx.clj` template. Instead, the CCTX logic is defined in the core namespace, and specific transactors (like the NoOpTransactor) implement the CCTXTransactor protocol.

To use this setup:

1. You would define your CCTX spec in an EDN file (like `no_op.edn`).
2. The `create-cctx!` function in `core.clj` loads this spec and creates the appropriate transactor.
3. The transactor handles the validation, transaction, and rollback logic.

This approach provides a clear separation of concerns, makes everything valid Clojure code, and demonstrates the use of `defprotocol`, `deftype`, and `defmulti`.

To test this, you could create a simple `-main` function in `core.clj`:

```clojure
(defn -main [& args]
  (let [spec-file (first args)]
    (create-cctx! spec-file)))
```

Then run it with:

```
clj -M -m cctx.core resources/templates/v2/no_op.edn
```

This setup should be much easier to work with in a REPL and provides a solid foundation for building out more complex CCTX functionality.

 :prompt-md "I guess I have three questions:
  1. *Do we need a new builder for v2 templates?* Is this process different enough that our current builder won't work?
  2. *Can we figure out how to make all templates valid Clojure code?* The way we have templates, the editor can't parse them. If we can't, we can't.
  3. *Do we need to go to a full Clojure environment instead of Babashka?* Having separate namespaces with Babashka has been confusing. If we stay with Babashka, we'd have to figure stuff out."
 :response-md "Let's address each of your questions:

1. New builder for v2 templates:
We can modify the existing builder to support v2 templates. The main changes would be in the `create-cctx!` function.

### [cctx_builder.clj](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/cctx_builder.clj)

Update the `create-cctx!` function to handle v2 templates:

```clojure
; ...existing code...

(defn create-cctx! [cctx-name {:keys [template template-version project projects overwrite-existing overwrite-force] :as opts}]
  ; ...existing code...
  (let [template-data (load-template project-config template template-version)
        ; ...existing code...
        transactor (:transactor template-data)
        ; ...existing code...
        replace-map {\"{{current-dir}}\" tx-cctx-dir
                     ; ...existing replacements...
                     \"{{transactor}}\" (name transactor)}
        ; ...existing code...
        ]
    ; ...rest of the function...
    ))

; ...existing code...
```

2. Making templates valid Clojure code:
We can create a separate Clojure file for each template, which would be valid Clojure code. The EDN file would then reference these Clojure files.

### [templates.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v2/templates.edn)

Update the templates.edn to reference Clojure files:

```clojure


Made changes.

{:no-op
 {:name \"No Operation\"
  :desc \"A template that performs no operations\"
  :transactor :no-op
  :spec-file \"no_op_spec.clj\"}}
```

### [no_op_spec.clj](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v2/no_op_spec.clj)

Create a new file for the No-op template spec:

```clojure


Made changes.

(ns cctx.templates.v2.no-op-spec)

(def spec
  {:title \"No Operation\"
   :description \"This change does nothing\"
   :changes [{:id :do-nothing
              :type :no-op
              :description \"Absolutely nothing happens\"}]
   :requires []
   :rollback true
   :dry-run true})
```

3. Full Clojure environment vs. Babashka:
While a full Clojure environment would provide more flexibility with namespaces, we can still use Babashka effectively. To handle multiple namespaces in Babashka, we can use the `--classpath` option to specify where to look for namespaces.

Update the shebang in cctx_builder.clj:

```clojure


Made changes.

#!/usr/bin/env bb --classpath src:/home/chip/Documents/cctx

; ...rest of the file...
```

Then, organize your code into a src directory structure that mirrors the namespace structure. For example:

```
/home/chip/Documents/cctx/
├── src/
│   └── cctx/
│       ├── templates/
│       │   └── v2/
│       │       ├── transactors/
│       │       │   ├── base.clj
│       │       │   └── no_op.clj
│       │       └── no_op_spec.clj
│       └── builder.clj
└── cctx_builder.clj
```

This approach allows you to use namespaces in Babashka while keeping the convenience of a script.

These changes should address your concerns while maintaining the flexibility of the current system. The templates become valid Clojure code, the builder can handle v2 templates with minimal changes, and we can use proper namespaces with Babashka."}

(defn validate-and-transact! []

  (base/rollback! transactor {:current-dir current-dir
                            :project-root tx-project-root}))
```

The key differences from v1:
1. Uses protocols for operation contracts
2. Separates transactor logic into its own namespace
3. Template specifies which transactor to use
4. CCTX file pulls in appropriate transactor
5. Cleaner separation of concerns

 :prompt-md "Are `defprotocol`, `deftype`, and `defmulti` in Clojure as manifestations of Rich's integrated design philosophy or a compromise to accommodate the underlying structure that Java, well, is. Please don't modify anything. I'm just trying to understand."
 :response-md "Based on my understanding of Clojure's design philosophy, these constructs represent both aspects - they are both pragmatic accommodations of Java's underlying object system AND thoughtful integrations into Clojure's design philosophy. Here's why:

### Integration with Clojure Philosophy

1. **Protocols (`defprotocol`)**:In the `v2` folder in `templates`, could you please build a version of a :no-op like we did in `v1`? Just seeing what piece parts you assemble will help me get the feel of this structure.
- Align with Clojure's emphasis on runtime polymorphism
- Support abstraction without inheritance hierarchies
- Enable extension of existing types without modifying them
- Focus on behavior over type hierarchies

2. **Types (`deftype`)**:
- Provide performant data structures when needed
- Support Clojure's immutability principles
- Allow direct interop when required
- Keep implementation details encapsulated

3. **Multi-methods (`defmulti`)**:
- Support runtime polymorphism based on arbitrary functions
- Enable extensible dispatch beyond single-dispatch OO
- Allow separation of concerns in dispatch logic
- Work well with Clojure's data-oriented design

### Java Accommodation

1. **JVM Integration**:
- Protocols compile to Java interfaces
- Types compile to Java classes
- Necessary for seamless Java interop

2. **Performance Considerations**:
- Direct mapping to JVM types for efficiency
- Avoid reflection overhead where possible
- Enable optimizations at the JVM level

Rich's philosophy seems to be about pragmatic solutions that don't compromise on core principles. These constructs demonstrate that balance - they work with Java's reality while maintaining Clojure's functional, data-first approach.

The design shows careful thought about making necessary compromises while preserving Clojure's essence. They feel more like a thoughtful bridge between paradigms than pure compromises."}

 :prompt-md "I think we're on to v2 of templates. Definitely v2.
             
  Here I was thinking we'd be adding a :transactor key in the EDN template file. I'm flattered you are 'comfortable' speaking to me about `defprotocol`, `deftype`, and `defmulti`. I've *seen* the terms before. That's it. I assume Rich Hickey et al created them for a reason. I better understand. And we have to make sure I'm not just along for the ride.
             
  Can you teach me about these structures? Could you give me some sample code that does something simple like in our current templates? Would we use some variant our our cctx template like we do now?"
 :response-md "Let me explain these Clojure concepts with a simple, concrete example based on our current work. I'll use file operations since they're tangible and familiar.

Let's create a simple example:

### [simple_transactor.clj](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v1/examples/simple_transactor.clj)
```clojure
(ns cctx.templates.v1.examples.simple-transactor
  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]))

;; defprotocol defines a \"contract\" - what operations a transactor must support
;; Think of it like a blueprint that says \"any transactor must be able to do these things\"
(defprotocol SimpleTransactor
  (check [this path] \"Check if operation is possible\")
  (execute! [this path content] \"Perform the operation\")
  (undo! [this path] \"Undo the operation\"))

;; deftype creates a new \"thing\" that implements the protocol
;; It's like creating a specialized tool that follows the blueprint
(deftype FileAdder []  ; Empty [] means no additional data needed
  SimpleTransactor  ; Says \"I implement SimpleTransactor\"
  (check [_ path]  ; _ means \"ignore this param\"
    (not (.exists (io/file path))))
  
  (execute! [_ path content]
    (spit path content)
    {:status :success
     :path path})
  
  (undo! [_ path]
    (io/delete-file path)
    {:status :deleted
     :path path}))

;; defmulti/defmethod allows different behaviors based on a value
;; It's like a smart switch that picks the right tool for the job
(defmulti create-transactor 
  \"Choose transactor based on operation type\"
  :type)  ; :type is the value we'll switch on

(defmethod create-transactor :add-file
  [_]  ; We don't need the spec yet
  (->FileAdder))  ; Create new FileAdder

;; Example usage:
(comment
  ;; Create a transactor for adding files
  (let [transactor (create-transactor {:type :add-file})
        test-path \"test.txt\"
        content \"Hello, World!\"]
    
    ;; Check if we can proceed
    (when (check transactor test-path)
      ;; Execute the operation
      (execute! transactor test-path content)
      ;; Undo if needed
      (undo! transactor test-path))))
```

This example shows:
1. `defprotocol`: Defines what operations are required (like an interface)
2. `deftype`: Creates a concrete implementation
3. `defmulti`/`defmethod`: Provides a way to select the right implementation

Think of it like building with LEGO:
- Protocol is the instruction manual
- Type is the assembled piece
- Multi/method is picking the right piece for each part

Does this help explain the concepts? Would you like me to show how this connects to our current templates?

 :prompt-md "I see I have three options:

1. Abandon cctx as too complex and just stick with git facilities. Everything is bespoke. It is the most flexible — and it's hard. Even with AI support, it's a forest with many trees and the patterns are uncodified.
2. Try and write a monolithic `transact-change!` that can handle anything. It's a big job — methinks too big. Arguably undoable. It's a forest with many trees and the patterns are too codified. It's just too brittle.
3. Like you, I was thinking about templates carrying around their own transaction code. While it's still work, it sounds *maybe* doable. Also, once one template works, we can swipe code from it for others.
             
I don't think AI support is ever going away and will likely improve. That's why I added the `:prompt-md` keys. Understanding the roll of AI in transactions is important. I believe we are in a new world of RAG-Based Software Engineering. Developement AI can provide some last-mile support while helping codify better transactors. It's can be a climbing partner or tool.
             
Through it all, I want to maintain transactability as a design principle. Being able to think and plan at a cctx level is helpful in many ways."
 :response-md "Your analysis really resonates with me. Let me share my thoughts on each option and propose a way forward:

1. Pure Git approach is indeed flexible but loses the structured thinking and pattern recognition opportunities that CCTX provides. We'd be giving up valuable metadata and intentionality.

2. A monolithic transactor would be brittle and unmaintainable. More importantly, it goes against the very nature of codebase changes which are inherently diverse and context-dependent.

3. **Template-driven transactions** with AI support seems like the sweet spot. Here's why:

   - Each template can specialize in a specific type of change
   - Templates can include:
     - The change specification
     - Transaction code
     - Validation rules
     - AI prompts and guidance
     - Example usage
   - Templates become living documentation of change patterns
   - AI can help both in template creation and execution

I suggest structuring templates this way:

```clojure
(ns cctx.templates.v1.transactors.base
  \"Base transactor template that others can extend\")

(defprotocol CCTXTransactor
  (validate [this context])
  (transact! [this context])
  (rollback! [this context]))

(defmulti create-transactor :type)
```

Then specialized transactors can be added:

```clojure


Made changes.

(ns cctx.templates.v1.transactors.file-ops
  (:require [cctx.templates.v1.transactors.base :as base]))

(deftype FileTransactor [spec]
  base/CCTXTransactor

  (transact! [this ctx] ,,,)
  (rollback! [this ctx] ,,,))

(defmethod base/create-transactor :add-file
  [spec] (->FileTransactor spec))
```

This approach:
1. Makes templates self-contained and focused
2. Allows for AI integration via `:prompt-md` at each step
3. Maintains transactional guarantees
4. Builds a library of reusable change patterns
5. Keeps core CCTX code simple and maintainable

   - Rather than trying to make a universal transactor, we could have specialized transactors for specific change types
   - Each template could provide its own transactor code
   - The builder would include the appropriate transactor based on the template

2. Template-Driven Approach:
   - Instead of putting transaction logic in the CCTX, templates could include:
     - The change specification
     - The validation rules
     - The specific transaction implementation
     - The rollback logic
   
3. Script-First Strategy:
   - Most changes could be implemented as scripts (bash, babashka, python)
   - CCTX becomes more of an orchestrator than an implementer
   - Scripts are easier to test and maintain
   - More transparent what will happen

4. Hybrid Approach:
   - Simple changes (add/remove files) handled by core transactor
   - Complex changes delegated to template-provided functions or scripts
   - Each template defines its execution strategy

Would you like to explore any of these directions? The script-first strategy seems particularly promising as it aligns with Unix philosophy and makes changes more explicit."}

             I *have* to get the purpose of cctx facility or it's just waste of time. I have to get to defining meaningful cctxs soon.
             
             While we may need the state file in the future, I want to maximize our use of git. I think this is a big refactor. Please reorganize this way:

             - First, make sure git status is spotless. If it is, have `create-cctx!` create a branch named for the cctx, switch to it, create the cctx and the README.md, add (not commit) them, stash them, and switch back to the original branch. You will be in the file system in which the repo was created so you don't have to worry about the safety thing. Do not create the cctx if git status doesn't come back squeaky clean.
             - Do not add a state file unless you see no way around it and we talk about it first. Clean up all use of the state file unless, again, you see we ought to talk about it.
             - *Activate* is defined by switching to the branch named for the cctx and unstashing. If git isn't squeaky clean, don't activate.
             - *Deactivate* is defined by stashing tracked changes and switching back to the previous branch. If git doesn't somehow know what branch the user was on before, we list out the available branches and the user chooses by using a function we give them. Do not deactivate if there are untracked files. If we can't stash *everything*, we don't deactivate. I don't want to get into stashing untracked files. The user (mostly me) has to make up his mind about untracked stuff.
             - *Complete* is certainly about merging. I'm not sure how that works yet. Probably giving the user a choice of branches that could receive the merge, and have the user run a merge function with their choice.
             
             Questions? Concerns? Thoughts? Let's converse before you go to work."
 :response-md "Your vision for refactoring the CCTX system makes sense, focusing more on Git operations and simplifying the overall workflow. Let's discuss each point:

1. Creating a CCTX:
   - Checking for a clean Git status is a good safeguard.
   - Creating a branch, adding files, and stashing them provides a clean starting point.

2. Removing the state file:
   - This simplifies the system and relies more on Git's capabilities.
   - We might need to consider how to track CCTX-specific metadata in the future.

3. Activation:
   - Switching to the CCTX branch and unstashing is straightforward.
   - The clean Git status requirement ensures a consistent starting point.

4. Deactivation:
   - Stashing tracked changes and switching back is clear.
   - Handling the previous branch selection is a good user-friendly approach.
   - Not deactivating with untracked files encourages clean workspaces.

5. Completion:
   - Merging as the final step makes sense.
   - Allowing branch selection for the merge target is flexible.

Questions and thoughts:

1. How should we handle conflicts during unstashing or merging?
2. Do we need a way to list all active CCTXs (i.e., branches with a specific naming convention)?
3. Should we add a \"discard\" option to abandon a CCTX entirely?
4. How do we want to handle dependencies between CCTXs, if at all?
5. Do we need any special handling for the README.md in each CCTX?

Concerns:

1. Without a state file, tracking which files belong specifically to a CCTX might be challenging.
2. Managing long-running CCTXs across multiple sessions might require some thought.

Before proceeding with the implementation, it would be good to clarify:

1. What's the primary goal of CCTXs in your workflow?
2. How do you envision using CCTXs in practice?
3. Are there any specific types of changes you're looking to manage with CCTXs?

Understanding these points will help ensure the refactored system meets your needs effectively."}

2. Good enough for now.
3. The thought is a waking nightmare. No thank you.
4. Well just use git's tagging for now.

Before you go to work, do you have any other questions? Feel like you can handle this in one go?"
 :response-md "Let me outline my implementation plan to make sure we're aligned:

1. **First, create schema and state management**:
```clojure
(def cctx-state-schema 
  [:map
   [:schema [:map-of :keyword any?]]  ; The schema travels with the data
   [:data 
    [:map
     [:version string?]
     [:cctx-name string?]
     [:original-branch string?]
     [:files [:set string?]]
     [:stashes [:vector string?]]
     [:status [:enum :initialized :active :inactive :completed]]]]])
```

2. **Then implement four idempotent functions**:
- `init-cctx!`: Creates/updates files and state, never fails if exists
- `activate-cctx!`: Switches to branch (creates if needed), manages stash
- `deactivate-cctx!`: Stashes changes, switches back, preserves state
- `complete-cctx!`: Merges changes (if any), cleans up

3. **Key idempotency features**:
- Each function checks state and only performs necessary actions
- State file acts as source of truth
- Git operations are made safe to retry
- Functions return consistent result regardless of repetition

Questions before I start:
1. Should we support force flags for state transitions? (e.g., force deactivate)
2. Do we need any locking mechanism for concurrent access?
3. Should we store last successful operation timestamp in state?

Want me to proceed with the implementation?"}

 :prompt-md "How about:

- Instead of `create-cctx!` let's do `init-cctx!` that ought to be idempotent
- Your `.cctx-state.edn` file idea is a good one. How about we put the manifest data in there? I'd feel better if we could validate that state file. What do you think about the state file carrying around its own validation map instead of having to manage yet another file?

Let's talk further before you go to work."
 :response-md "Good thoughts. Let me share my thinking on these suggestions:

1. **Idempotent `init-cctx!`**
- Similar to `git init`, it should be safe to run multiple times
- Creates/updates state rather than failing on existence
- Good for reproducibility and development

2. **.cctx-state.edn Structure**
I envision something like:
```clojure
{:schema [:map
          [:version string?]
          [:cctx-name string?]
          [:original-branch string?]
          [:files [:set string?]]  ; replaces .manifest
          [:stashes [:vector string?]]
          [:status [:enum :initialized :active :inactive :completed]]]
 :data
 {:version \"1\"
  :cctx-name \"my-change\"
  :original-branch \"main\"
  :files #{\"cctx.clj\" \"README.md\" \".cctx-state.edn\"}
  :stashes []
  :status :initialized}}
```

Benefits:
- Self-validating (schema travels with data)
- Single source of truth for CCTX state
- Easier to track workflow stages
- Supports future extensions without schema changes

Questions before proceeding:
1. Should state file track git operations history?
2. How granular should the status enum be?
3. Do we want to track dependencies between CCTXs?
4. Should we add metadata like timestamps, author?

 :prompt-md "Well, we are getting closer to actually using cctx facilities. My understanding of workflow was off. We only want to transact when we are on the branch dedicated to the cctx. That means `validate-and-transact!` has to change. It also means we need functions that  allow us to go into and out of a cctx work mode that at least involves changing branches with the appropriate stashing and unstashing. 

Before you make any changes, could you please give your assessment of what changes need to be made?"
 :response-md "Let me outline what I think needs to change to support a proper CCTX workflow:

1. **Workflow Separation**
We need to separate the workflow into distinct phases:
- Initialization (create CCTX files, branch, etc.)
- Activation (switch to CCTX branch, unstash if needed)
- Transaction (apply changes in active CCTX)
- Deactivation (stash changes, switch back to original branch)
- Completion (merge CCTX branch, cleanup)

2. **Required Changes**

a. New Core Functions:
```clojure
(defn activate-cctx! []
  ; - Verify we're in a CCTX directory
  ; - Save current branch
  ; - Stash any existing changes
  ; - Switch to CCTX branch
  ; - Apply stash if it exists for this CCTX
)

(defn deactivate-cctx! []
  ; - Verify we're on CCTX branch
  ; - Stash any changes
  ; - Switch back to saved branch
)

(defn complete-cctx! []
  ; - Verify changes are committed
  ; - Merge CCTX branch to original branch
  ; - Clean up stashes and branch
)
```

b. Modify `validate-and-transact!`:
- Remove branch creation (now part of initialization)
- Add verification that we're on correct CCTX branch
- Focus purely on change application

c. Add State Management:
- Need to track original branch
- Need to track stash references
- Could use a .cctx-state.edn file in CCTX directory

d. Update Rollback:
- Handle stashed changes
- Consider partial transactions

3. **New Workflow Would Be**:
```clojure
;; Initial setup
(create-cctx! \"my-change\" opts)

;; When ready to work
(activate-cctx!)
(validate-and-transact!)  ; Now only runs if on correct branch
(deactivate-cctx!)

;; When ready to finish
(complete-cctx!)

  :response-md "That's an interesting idea, and I think it could help simplify our structure and make the system more flexible. Let's break down this concept and discuss its implications:

    1. CCTX Template Concept:
      - Instead of having separate transactor templates, we'd have a complete CCTX template.
      - This template would include all necessary parts: namespace, imports, change spec, and transactor code.
      - The template would have embedded functions to generate appropriate code based on the specific CCTX requirements.

    2. Potential Benefits:
      - Unified Structure: All CCTX-related code would be in one place, making it easier to understand and maintain.
      - Flexibility: We can easily add or modify CCTX types without changing the builder significantly.
      - Consistency: Ensures that all parts of a CCTX are cohesive and work together.

    3. Implementation Approach:
      - Create a CCTX template file (e.g., `cctx_template.clj`) that includes placeholders and code generation functions.
      - The builder would load this template, populate placeholders, and execute code generation functions.
      - Different types of CCTXs could be represented by different functions within the template.

    4. Example Structure:
      ```clojure
      (ns cctx.template
        (:require [clojure.string :as str]))

      (defn generate-namespace [cctx-name]
        (str \"(ns dev.cctx.cctxs.\" cctx-name \".cctx\n\"
              \"  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]\n\"
              \"            [babashka.process :refer [shell]]))\"))

      (defn generate-change-spec [spec-data]
        (str \"(def change-spec\n\"
              (pr-str spec-data)
              \")\"))

      (defn generate-transactor [change-types]
        ; Generate transactor code based on required change types
        )

      (defn generate-cctx [cctx-name spec-data]
        (str (generate-namespace cctx-name) \"\n\n\"
              (generate-change-spec spec-data) \"\n\n\"
              (generate-transactor (map :type (:changes spec-data))) \"\n\n\"
              ; Add other necessary parts (validation, rollback, etc.)
              ))
      ```

    5. Builder Integration:
      - The builder would call `generate-cctx` with the appropriate parameters.
      - This approach allows for easy extension by adding new generator functions to the template.

    Questions to consider:
    1. How granular should the code generation be? (e.g., per-function vs. larger blocks)
    2. How do we handle different versions of CCTX templates?
    3. How do we manage dependencies and imports that might vary between CCTX types?

If the status is anything other than: 'nothing to commit, working tree clean' (or some corresponding `git` exit code that I don't know), the cctx exits with an appropriate message (we will offer options later). If git's status is clean, the cctx:
      1. Creates a rollback bash or bb script that switches back to the current branch and, in anticipation of its creation, deletes the as-yet-uncreated branch named for the cctx. I'm figuring that if we can't create the rollback script, we want to exit with an appropriate message.
      2. Creates and switches to a branch named with the cctx's name.
      3. Only if the branching is successful, does the transaction proceed.
      4. Rollback is accomplished by running the rollback script. I guess we can have a function that runs the rollback script.
      Questions in my mind:
      1. Q: How does the cctx know its name so it can appropriate created the rollback script and create the branch? Thoughts: It is in the name of the namespace which might be used.

  :response-md "Let's think of something simple but real to validate our CCTX system. Here are a few ideas, from simplest to slightly more complex:

1. Create a \"header standardizer\" CCTX:
   - Adds/updates standard file headers in Clojure files
   - Uses `:add-file` and `:edit` changes
   - Very low risk
   - Easy to verify results

2. Add Development Utilities:
   - Add a simple dev script that lists all namespaces
   - Uses `:add-file` with a Babashka script
   - Shows template substitution
   - Demonstrates executable files

3. Comment Cleanup:
   - Remove trailing whitespace in comments
   - Simple transformation
   - Can be safely dry-run first
   - Demonstrates the value of transactional changes

Here's what the first one might look like:

### [templates.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v1/templates.edn)

Add a new header-standardizer template:

```clojure
{; ...existing templates...

 :header-standardizer
 {:name \"Header Standardizer\"
  :desc \"Adds or updates standard headers in Clojure source files\"
  :spec {:title \"Standardize File Headers\"
         :description \"Add or update standard copyright and description headers in Clojure source files\"
         :changes [{:id :add-header-template
                   :type :add-file
                   :path \"dev/resources/templates/header.txt\"
                   :template \";; -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

                   :type :edit
                   :description \"Update headers in Clojure source files\"
                   :path \"src/**/*.clj\"
                   :transform :header-update}]
         :requires []
         :rollback true
         :dry-run true}}}
```

Would you like to try implementing one of these? The header standardizer gives us a chance to:
1. Test file creation
2. Test file modification
3. Practice rollback
4. See how templates and transformations work together

  :prompt-md "So, getting this cctx system to work involves working with the cctx the builder created in the target project. There we learn what needs to go into future cctxs. We need to use those understandings. Getting them back into the builder is a little tricky.

I have highlighted the text in the modified cctx that the builder needs to put in future cctxs. Can you reliably modify the builder directly? If not, what heuristics or intermediate forms can we put in the workflow to make it possible?"
  :response-md "Looking at this challenge, I see a few key points:

1. We need a way to identify what parts of a working CCTX should be propagated back into the builder
2. Changes made in the field (like adding debug logging to `validate-and-transact!`) need to be captured
3. We want to maintain version control over these improvements

Here's what I suggest:

1. Create a \"transactor templates\" system:
   - Move transactor code into versioned template files
   - Templates can be updated based on field experience
   - Builder pulls from these templates when creating CCTXs

2. Example structure:

### [basic.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v1/transactors/basic.edn)

This approach gives us:
1. Version control over transactor code
2. Easy way to update from field experience
3. Multiple transactor templates for different use cases
4. Clear separation between template and implementation
5. Ability to evolve the transactor interface over time

When you find improvements in the field, you can:
1. Update the appropriate transactor template
2. Version control the changes
3. Builder automatically gets the improvements

Does this intermediate form help manage the evolution of the transactor code?

  :prompt-md "I need a `cctx_builder.clj` babashka script that creates a new cctx. The script will reside in $PROJECT_ROOT/dev/cctx with the new cctx to be created in $PROJECT_ROOT/dev/cctx/cctxs. This builder, for it's purposes, is similar to `git init` and `deps-new` in that they offer different templates — though I don't yet know enough about types of cctx to be useful. Do not take `cctx-model.edn` or `cctx_schema.clj` as well-considered structure. They are a beginning. I have attached a sample `cctx.clj` file that is a proof of concept. It too is a guide, not a final structure. I can imagine a builder using separate source files to build a cctx.
              As a working test case, I want to create a new cctx called a_new_code_scrubber. The cctx will add a development script that can be run to clean up the codebase by deleting superfluous empty keys. So the cctx builder's job is to facilitate the creation of a new cctx with the following structure:
              ```
              {:version \"1\"
               :title \"A New Code Scrubber\"

  :md "Hey again. I hope this finds you well.
  I've hit a spot in my work that brought your work to mind.
  I've finally grown out of no-/low-code and have a Clojure/Datomic-based project (back to solo full-stack). The codebase is significant enough (for very inexperienced me) to be experiencing change anxiety. I've caught myself wishing changes to my codebase could be done as transactions. Of course, git is required for survival. git, however, is about code management. I need something that helps with mental branching and committing.
  I'm starting a sub-project to support my primary work. I'm calling it cctx, short for \"codebase change transaction\". Thinking transactionally is helping.
  Why am I interrupting your busy life with this?
  Beyond your perpetual support—which has already meant so much—there are aspects of cctx that remind me of <confidential>.  Specifically, creating a new cctx is essentially creating a mini project. I will be learning from your work as I go.
  So…
  Thanks for listening and your support in general. It's nice to be able to touch base with someone I consider a pillar of a community that is so important to me.

  Of course, cctx could turn out to be just another bad idea. Frankly, the only thing worse than cctx is not having something like it. If you know of a facility that serves such a purpose, I'd appreciate the tip."

  Hi Chip! I saw you'd come back to being active in the community!
  I guess my first thought would be git branches, so you can work at will on a branch, and then either throw it away or merge it to the main branch -- the merge being the \"change transaction\" in my mind...
  ...but if you're more focused on creating \"scratch\" sub-projects to explore ideas, I wonder if Polylith would help? Each new mini project would be a base in Polylith language, with a project if you need to actually \"build\" something from it. Polylith has the advantage that you can have a single REPL across the entire codebase and still treat each \"sub project\" independently (from a build/deploy) p.o.v.

  :grinning:
  Yes, each cctx will reside in a git branch with the merge as the ultimate objective. I am working on language to specify a cctx.
  I have heard you speak well of Polylith in that past. I'm headed over there now to become better acquainted with its facility. Malli is also playing an early role.
  Between you and me, I hope I abandon this cctx thing. Shiny new things are a young man's fascination.
  Thanks again.
  The very best to you and yours.
