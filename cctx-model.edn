 :prompt-md "The primary purpose of a CCTX is to encourage thoughtful, structured changes to the codebase based on developer sanity, clarity, and quiet judgement.

             I *have* to get the purpose of cctx facility or it's just waste of time. I have to get to defining meaningful cctxs soon.
             
             While we may need the state file in the future, I want to maximize our use of git. I think this is a big refactor. Please reorganize this way:

             - First, make sure git status is spotless. If it is, have `create-cctx!` create a branch named for the cctx, switch to it, create the cctx and the README.md, add (not commit) them, stash them, and switch back to the original branch. You will be in the file system in which the repo was created so you don't have to worry about the safety thing. Do not create the cctx if git status doesn't come back squeaky clean.
             - Do not add a state file unless you see no way around it and we talk about it first. Clean up all use of the state file unless, again, you see we ought to talk about it.
             - *Activate* is defined by switching to the branch named for the cctx and unstashing. If git isn't squeaky clean, don't activate.
             - *Deactivate* is defined by stashing tracked changes and switching back to the previous branch. If git doesn't somehow know what branch the user was on before, we list out the available branches and the user chooses by using a function we give them. Do not deactivate if there are untracked files. If we can't stash *everything*, we don't deactivate. I don't want to get into stashing untracked files. The user (mostly me) has to make up his mind about untracked stuff.
             - *Complete* is certainly about merging. I'm not sure how that works yet. Probably giving the user a choice of branches that could receive the merge, and have the user run a merge function with their choice.
             
             Questions? Concerns? Thoughts? Let's converse before you go to work."
 :response-md "Your vision for refactoring the CCTX system makes sense, focusing more on Git operations and simplifying the overall workflow. Let's discuss each point:

1. Creating a CCTX:
   - Checking for a clean Git status is a good safeguard.
   - Creating a branch, adding files, and stashing them provides a clean starting point.

2. Removing the state file:
   - This simplifies the system and relies more on Git's capabilities.
   - We might need to consider how to track CCTX-specific metadata in the future.

3. Activation:
   - Switching to the CCTX branch and unstashing is straightforward.
   - The clean Git status requirement ensures a consistent starting point.

4. Deactivation:
   - Stashing tracked changes and switching back is clear.
   - Handling the previous branch selection is a good user-friendly approach.
   - Not deactivating with untracked files encourages clean workspaces.

5. Completion:
   - Merging as the final step makes sense.
   - Allowing branch selection for the merge target is flexible.

Questions and thoughts:

1. How should we handle conflicts during unstashing or merging?
2. Do we need a way to list all active CCTXs (i.e., branches with a specific naming convention)?
3. Should we add a \"discard\" option to abandon a CCTX entirely?
4. How do we want to handle dependencies between CCTXs, if at all?
5. Do we need any special handling for the README.md in each CCTX?

Concerns:

1. Without a state file, tracking which files belong specifically to a CCTX might be challenging.
2. Managing long-running CCTXs across multiple sessions might require some thought.

Before proceeding with the implementation, it would be good to clarify:

1. What's the primary goal of CCTXs in your workflow?
2. How do you envision using CCTXs in practice?
3. Are there any specific types of changes you're looking to manage with CCTXs?

Understanding these points will help ensure the refactored system meets your needs effectively."}

 :prompt-md "Actually, all four functions need to be idempotent.

The state file structure looks good to my early-at-this eye.

To your questions:
1. Maybe later.
2. Good enough for now.
3. The thought is a waking nightmare. No thank you.
4. Well just use git's tagging for now.

Before you go to work, do you have any other questions? Feel like you can handle this in one go?"
 :response-md "Let me outline my implementation plan to make sure we're aligned:

1. **First, create schema and state management**:
```clojure
(def cctx-state-schema 
  [:map
   [:schema [:map-of :keyword any?]]  ; The schema travels with the data
   [:data 
    [:map
     [:version string?]
     [:cctx-name string?]
     [:original-branch string?]
     [:files [:set string?]]
     [:stashes [:vector string?]]
     [:status [:enum :initialized :active :inactive :completed]]]]])
```

2. **Then implement four idempotent functions**:
- `init-cctx!`: Creates/updates files and state, never fails if exists
- `activate-cctx!`: Switches to branch (creates if needed), manages stash
- `deactivate-cctx!`: Stashes changes, switches back, preserves state
- `complete-cctx!`: Merges changes (if any), cleans up

3. **Key idempotency features**:
- Each function checks state and only performs necessary actions
- State file acts as source of truth
- Git operations are made safe to retry
- Functions return consistent result regardless of repetition

Questions before I start:
1. Should we support force flags for state transitions? (e.g., force deactivate)
2. Do we need any locking mechanism for concurrent access?
3. Should we store last successful operation timestamp in state?

Want me to proceed with the implementation?"}

 :prompt-md "How about:

- Instead of `create-cctx!` let's do `init-cctx!` that ought to be idempotent
- Your `.cctx-state.edn` file idea is a good one. How about we put the manifest data in there? I'd feel better if we could validate that state file. What do you think about the state file carrying around its own validation map instead of having to manage yet another file?

Let's talk further before you go to work."
 :response-md "Good thoughts. Let me share my thinking on these suggestions:

1. **Idempotent `init-cctx!`**
- Similar to `git init`, it should be safe to run multiple times
- Creates/updates state rather than failing on existence
- Good for reproducibility and development

2. **.cctx-state.edn Structure**
I envision something like:
```clojure
{:schema [:map
          [:version string?]
          [:cctx-name string?]
          [:original-branch string?]
          [:files [:set string?]]  ; replaces .manifest
          [:stashes [:vector string?]]
          [:status [:enum :initialized :active :inactive :completed]]]
 :data
 {:version \"1\"
  :cctx-name \"my-change\"
  :original-branch \"main\"
  :files #{\"cctx.clj\" \"README.md\" \".cctx-state.edn\"}
  :stashes []
  :status :initialized}}
```

Benefits:
- Self-validating (schema travels with data)
- Single source of truth for CCTX state
- Easier to track workflow stages
- Supports future extensions without schema changes

Questions before proceeding:
1. Should state file track git operations history?
2. How granular should the status enum be?
3. Do we want to track dependencies between CCTXs?
4. Should we add metadata like timestamps, author?

What are your thoughts on this direction?"}

 :prompt-md "Well, we are getting closer to actually using cctx facilities. My understanding of workflow was off. We only want to transact when we are on the branch dedicated to the cctx. That means `validate-and-transact!` has to change. It also means we need functions that  allow us to go into and out of a cctx work mode that at least involves changing branches with the appropriate stashing and unstashing. 

Before you make any changes, could you please give your assessment of what changes need to be made?"
 :response-md "Let me outline what I think needs to change to support a proper CCTX workflow:

1. **Workflow Separation**
We need to separate the workflow into distinct phases:
- Initialization (create CCTX files, branch, etc.)
- Activation (switch to CCTX branch, unstash if needed)
- Transaction (apply changes in active CCTX)
- Deactivation (stash changes, switch back to original branch)
- Completion (merge CCTX branch, cleanup)

2. **Required Changes**

a. New Core Functions:
```clojure
(defn activate-cctx! []
  ; - Verify we're in a CCTX directory
  ; - Save current branch
  ; - Stash any existing changes
  ; - Switch to CCTX branch
  ; - Apply stash if it exists for this CCTX
)

(defn deactivate-cctx! []
  ; - Verify we're on CCTX branch
  ; - Stash any changes
  ; - Switch back to saved branch
)

(defn complete-cctx! []
  ; - Verify changes are committed
  ; - Merge CCTX branch to original branch
  ; - Clean up stashes and branch
)
```

b. Modify `validate-and-transact!`:
- Remove branch creation (now part of initialization)
- Add verification that we're on correct CCTX branch
- Focus purely on change application

c. Add State Management:
- Need to track original branch
- Need to track stash references
- Could use a .cctx-state.edn file in CCTX directory

d. Update Rollback:
- Handle stashed changes
- Consider partial transactions

3. **New Workflow Would Be**:
```clojure
;; Initial setup
(create-cctx! \"my-change\" opts)

;; When ready to work
(activate-cctx!)
(validate-and-transact!)  ; Now only runs if on correct branch
(deactivate-cctx!)

;; When ready to finish
(complete-cctx!)
```

Would you like me to proceed with implementing these changes? We can do it incrementally, starting with whichever part you think is most important."}

  :prompt-md "Hmm. The transactor code is in multiple places now.
             
             Instead of trying to clean it up, maybe another structural change is called for. What if instead of a 'transactor template', we work from a 'cctx template' that has embedded functions that are coded to generate the appropriate code for that cctx?
             
             Talk to me about this before you create anything. I'd like to make sure were on the same page."
  :response-md "That's an interesting idea, and I think it could help simplify our structure and make the system more flexible. Let's break down this concept and discuss its implications:

    1. CCTX Template Concept:
      - Instead of having separate transactor templates, we'd have a complete CCTX template.
      - This template would include all necessary parts: namespace, imports, change spec, and transactor code.
      - The template would have embedded functions to generate appropriate code based on the specific CCTX requirements.

    2. Potential Benefits:
      - Unified Structure: All CCTX-related code would be in one place, making it easier to understand and maintain.
      - Flexibility: We can easily add or modify CCTX types without changing the builder significantly.
      - Consistency: Ensures that all parts of a CCTX are cohesive and work together.

    3. Implementation Approach:
      - Create a CCTX template file (e.g., `cctx_template.clj`) that includes placeholders and code generation functions.
      - The builder would load this template, populate placeholders, and execute code generation functions.
      - Different types of CCTXs could be represented by different functions within the template.

    4. Example Structure:
      ```clojure
      (ns cctx.template
        (:require [clojure.string :as str]))

      (defn generate-namespace [cctx-name]
        (str \"(ns dev.cctx.cctxs.\" cctx-name \".cctx\n\"
              \"  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]\n\"
              \"            [babashka.process :refer [shell]]))\"))

      (defn generate-change-spec [spec-data]
        (str \"(def change-spec\n\"
              (pr-str spec-data)
              \")\"))

      (defn generate-transactor [change-types]
        ; Generate transactor code based on required change types
        )

      (defn generate-cctx [cctx-name spec-data]
        (str (generate-namespace cctx-name) \"\n\n\"
              (generate-change-spec spec-data) \"\n\n\"
              (generate-transactor (map :type (:changes spec-data))) \"\n\n\"
              ; Add other necessary parts (validation, rollback, etc.)
              ))
      ```

    5. Builder Integration:
      - The builder would call `generate-cctx` with the appropriate parameters.
      - This approach allows for easy extension by adding new generator functions to the template.

    Questions to consider:
    1. How granular should the code generation be? (e.g., per-function vs. larger blocks)
    2. How do we handle different versions of CCTX templates?
    3. How do we manage dependencies and imports that might vary between CCTX types?

    Does this align with what you had in mind? Would you like to explore any specific aspects of this approach further?"}

  :prompt-md "Maybe we'll do that — and we forgot to deal with cctx validation and rollback. Let's use `git` for this. I have a few ideas. Let's deal with rollback first. What if the first thing `validate-and-transact!` does is to `git status`. If the status is anything other than: 'nothing to commit, working tree clean' (or some corresponding `git` exit code that I don't know), the cctx exits with an appropriate message (we will offer options later). If git's status is clean, the cctx:
      1. Creates a rollback bash or bb script that switches back to the current branch and, in anticipation of its creation, deletes the as-yet-uncreated branch named for the cctx. I'm figuring that if we can't create the rollback script, we want to exit with an appropriate message.
      2. Creates and switches to a branch named with the cctx's name.
      3. Only if the branching is successful, does the transaction proceed.
      4. Rollback is accomplished by running the rollback script. I guess we can have a function that runs the rollback script.
      Questions in my mind:
      1. Q: How does the cctx know its name so it can appropriate created the rollback script and create the branch? Thoughts: It is in the name of the namespace which might be used.
      2. Q: Since we will have a number of git templates, do we just make rollback one of them and let the dev specify? Thoughts: Well...I'd rather make sure a cctx the builder created knows how the rollback the changes it transacted.

  :response-md "Let's think of something simple but real to validate our CCTX system. Here are a few ideas, from simplest to slightly more complex:

1. Create a \"header standardizer\" CCTX:
   - Adds/updates standard file headers in Clojure files
   - Uses `:add-file` and `:edit` changes
   - Very low risk
   - Easy to verify results

2. Add Development Utilities:
   - Add a simple dev script that lists all namespaces
   - Uses `:add-file` with a Babashka script
   - Shows template substitution
   - Demonstrates executable files

3. Comment Cleanup:
   - Remove trailing whitespace in comments
   - Simple transformation
   - Can be safely dry-run first
   - Demonstrates the value of transactional changes

Here's what the first one might look like:

### [templates.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v1/templates.edn)

Add a new header-standardizer template:

```clojure
{; ...existing templates...

 :header-standardizer
 {:name \"Header Standardizer\"
  :desc \"Adds or updates standard headers in Clojure source files\"
  :spec {:title \"Standardize File Headers\"
         :description \"Add or update standard copyright and description headers in Clojure source files\"
         :changes [{:id :add-header-template
                   :type :add-file
                   :path \"dev/resources/templates/header.txt\"
                   :template \";; -*- coding: utf-8 -*-

                   :description \"Update headers in Clojure source files\"

                   :transform :header-update}]
         :requires []
         :rollback true
         :dry-run true}}}
```

Would you like to try implementing one of these? The header standardizer gives us a chance to:
1. Test file creation
2. Test file modification
3. Practice rollback
4. See how templates and transformations work together

What do you think? Or do you have another simple change in mind?

1. Create a \"transactor templates\" system:
   - Move transactor code into versioned template files
   - Templates can be updated based on field experience
   - Builder pulls from these templates when creating CCTXs

2. Example structure:

### [basic.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v1/transactors/basic.edn)

This approach gives us:
1. Version control over transactor code
2. Easy way to update from field experience
3. Multiple transactor templates for different use cases
4. Clear separation between template and implementation
5. Ability to evolve the transactor interface over time

When you find improvements in the field, you can:
1. Update the appropriate transactor template
2. Version control the changes
3. Builder automatically gets the improvements

Does this intermediate form help manage the evolution of the transactor code?

  :prompt-md "I need a `cctx_builder.clj` babashka script that creates a new cctx. The script will reside in $PROJECT_ROOT/dev/cctx with the new cctx to be created in $PROJECT_ROOT/dev/cctx/cctxs. This builder, for it's purposes, is similar to `git init` and `deps-new` in that they offer different templates — though I don't yet know enough about types of cctx to be useful. Do not take `cctx-model.edn` or `cctx_schema.clj` as well-considered structure. They are a beginning. I have attached a sample `cctx.clj` file that is a proof of concept. It too is a guide, not a final structure. I can imagine a builder using separate source files to build a cctx.
              As a working test case, I want to create a new cctx called a_new_code_scrubber. The cctx will add a development script that can be run to clean up the codebase by deleting superfluous empty keys. So the cctx builder's job is to facilitate the creation of a new cctx with the following structure:
              ```
              {:version \"1\"
               :title \"A New Code Scrubber\"
               :description \"A code scrubber that removes empty keys from the codebase.\"
               :changes [{:id :remove-empty-keys
                          :type :remove-path
                          :description \"Remove empty keys from the codebase.\"

               :rollback true
               :dry-run true}
              ```
              To be *very* clear, I'm not asking for the cctx itself to be created. I'm asking for a script that creates a new cctx. The cctx itself will be created by running the builder."

  :md "Hey again. I hope this finds you well.
  I've hit a spot in my work that brought your work to mind.
  I've finally grown out of no-/low-code and have a Clojure/Datomic-based project (back to solo full-stack). The codebase is significant enough (for very inexperienced me) to be experiencing change anxiety. I've caught myself wishing changes to my codebase could be done as transactions. Of course, git is required for survival. git, however, is about code management. I need something that helps with mental branching and committing.
  I'm starting a sub-project to support my primary work. I'm calling it cctx, short for \"codebase change transaction\". Thinking transactionally is helping.
  Why am I interrupting your busy life with this?
  Beyond your perpetual support—which has already meant so much—there are aspects of cctx that remind me of <confidential>.  Specifically, creating a new cctx is essentially creating a mini project. I will be learning from your work as I go.
  So…
  Thanks for listening and your support in general. It's nice to be able to touch base with someone I consider a pillar of a community that is so important to me.

  Of course, cctx could turn out to be just another bad idea. Frankly, the only thing worse than cctx is not having something like it. If you know of a facility that serves such a purpose, I'd appreciate the tip."

  Hi Chip! I saw you'd come back to being active in the community!
  I guess my first thought would be git branches, so you can work at will on a branch, and then either throw it away or merge it to the main branch -- the merge being the \"change transaction\" in my mind...
  ...but if you're more focused on creating \"scratch\" subprojects to explore ideas, I wonder if Polylith would help? Each new mini project would be a base in Polylith language, with a project if you need to actually \"build\" something from it. Polylith has the advantage that you can have a single REPL across the entire codebase and still treat each \"sub project\" independently (from a build/deploy) p.o.v.

  :grinning:
  Yes, each cctx will reside in a git branch with the merge as the ultimate objective. I am working on language to specify a cctx.
  I have heard you speak well of Polylith in that past. I'm headed over there now to become better acquainted with its facility. Malli is also playing an early role.
  Between you and me, I hope I abandon this cctx thing. Shiny new things are a young man's fascination.
  Thanks again.
  The very best to you and yours.
