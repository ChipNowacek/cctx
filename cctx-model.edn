  :prompt-md "Hmm. The transactor code is in multiple places now.
             
             Instead of trying to clean it up, maybe another structural change is called for. What if instead of a 'transactor template', we work from a 'cctx template' that has embedded functions that are coded to generate the appropriate code for that cctx?
             
             Talk to me about this before you create anything. I'd like to make sure were on the same page."
  :response-md "That's an interesting idea, and I think it could help simplify our structure and make the system more flexible. Let's break down this concept and discuss its implications:

    1. CCTX Template Concept:
      - Instead of having separate transactor templates, we'd have a complete CCTX template.
      - This template would include all necessary parts: namespace, imports, change spec, and transactor code.
      - The template would have embedded functions to generate appropriate code based on the specific CCTX requirements.

    2. Potential Benefits:
      - Unified Structure: All CCTX-related code would be in one place, making it easier to understand and maintain.
      - Flexibility: We can easily add or modify CCTX types without changing the builder significantly.
      - Consistency: Ensures that all parts of a CCTX are cohesive and work together.

    3. Implementation Approach:
      - Create a CCTX template file (e.g., `cctx_template.clj`) that includes placeholders and code generation functions.
      - The builder would load this template, populate placeholders, and execute code generation functions.
      - Different types of CCTXs could be represented by different functions within the template.

    4. Example Structure:
      ```clojure
      (ns cctx.template
        (:require [clojure.string :as str]))

      (defn generate-namespace [cctx-name]
        (str \"(ns dev.cctx.cctxs.\" cctx-name \".cctx\n\"
              \"  (:require [clojure.java.io :as io]\n\"
              \"            [babashka.process :refer [shell]]))\"))

      (defn generate-change-spec [spec-data]
        (str \"(def change-spec\n\"
              (pr-str spec-data)
              \")\"))

      (defn generate-transactor [change-types]
        ; Generate transactor code based on required change types
        )

      (defn generate-cctx [cctx-name spec-data]
        (str (generate-namespace cctx-name) \"\n\n\"
              (generate-change-spec spec-data) \"\n\n\"
              (generate-transactor (map :type (:changes spec-data))) \"\n\n\"
              ; Add other necessary parts (validation, rollback, etc.)
              ))
      ```

    5. Builder Integration:
      - The builder would call `generate-cctx` with the appropriate parameters.
      - This approach allows for easy extension by adding new generator functions to the template.

    Questions to consider:
    1. How granular should the code generation be? (e.g., per-function vs. larger blocks)
    2. How do we handle different versions of CCTX templates?
    3. How do we manage dependencies and imports that might vary between CCTX types?

    Does this align with what you had in mind? Would you like to explore any specific aspects of this approach further?"}

Please make the transactor template valid Clojure code so the editor can help us. You'll bring in the clojure code directly when building the cctx.

  :prompt-md "Maybe we'll do that — and we forgot to deal with cctx validation and rollback. Let's use `git` for this. I have a few ideas. Let's deal with rollback first. What if the first thing `validate-and-transact!` does is to `git status`. If the status is anything other than: 'nothing to commit, working tree clean' (or some corresponding `git` exit code that I don't know), the cctx exits with an appropriate message (we will offer options later). If git's status is clean, the cctx:
      1. Creates a rollback bash or bb script that switches back to the current branch and, in anticipation of its creation, deletes the as-yet-uncreated branch named for the cctx. I'm figuring that if we can't create the rollback script, we want to exit with an appropriate message.
      2. Creates and switches to a branch named with the cctx's name.
      3. Only if the branching is successful, does the transaction proceed.
      4. Rollback is accomplished by running the rollback script. I guess we can have a function that runs the rollback script.
      Questions in my mind:
      1. Q: How does the cctx know its name so it can appropriate created the rollback script and create the branch? Thoughts: It is in the name of the namespace which might be used.
      2. Q: Since we will have a number of git templates, do we just make rollback one of them and let the dev specify? Thoughts: Well...I'd rather make sure a cctx the builder created knows how the rollback the changes it transacted.

We are now ready to create a cctx that does something. Help me think if something small and innocuous that we can do with a cctx."
  :response-md "Let's think of something simple but real to validate our CCTX system. Here are a few ideas, from simplest to slightly more complex:

1. Create a \"header standardizer\" CCTX:
   - Adds/updates standard file headers in Clojure files
   - Uses `:add-file` and `:edit` changes
   - Very low risk
   - Easy to verify results

2. Add Development Utilities:
   - Add a simple dev script that lists all namespaces
   - Uses `:add-file` with a Babashka script
   - Shows template substitution
   - Demonstrates executable files

3. Comment Cleanup:
   - Remove trailing whitespace in comments
   - Simple transformation
   - Can be safely dry-run first
   - Demonstrates the value of transactional changes

Here's what the first one might look like:

### [templates.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v1/templates.edn)

Add a new header-standardizer template:

```clojure
{; ...existing templates...

 :header-standardizer
 {:name \"Header Standardizer\"
  :desc \"Adds or updates standard headers in Clojure source files\"
  :spec {:title \"Standardize File Headers\"
         :description \"Add or update standard copyright and description headers in Clojure source files\"
         :changes [{:id :add-header-template
                   :type :add-file
                   :path \"dev/resources/templates/header.txt\"
                   :template \";; -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
;; Copyright © {{current-year}} {{project-name}} Contributors

\"}
                  {:id :update-headers
                   :type :edit
                   :description \"Update headers in Clojure source files\"
                   :path \"src/**/*.clj\"
                   :transform :header-update}]
         :requires []
         :rollback true
         :dry-run true}}}
```

Would you like to try implementing one of these? The header standardizer gives us a chance to:
1. Test file creation
2. Test file modification
3. Practice rollback
4. See how templates and transformations work together

What do you think? Or do you have another simple change in mind?

  :prompt-md "So, getting this cctx system to work involves working with the cctx the builder created in the target project. There we learn what needs to go into future cctxs. We need to use those understandings. Getting them back into the builder is a little tricky.

I have highlighted the text in the modified cctx that the builder needs to put in future cctxs. Can you reliably modify the builder directly? If not, what heuristics or intermediate forms can we put in the workflow to make it possible?"
  :response-md "Looking at this challenge, I see a few key points:

1. We need a way to identify what parts of a working CCTX should be propagated back into the builder
2. Changes made in the field (like adding debug logging to `validate-and-transact!`) need to be captured
3. We want to maintain version control over these improvements

Here's what I suggest:

1. Create a \"transactor templates\" system:
   - Move transactor code into versioned template files
   - Templates can be updated based on field experience
   - Builder pulls from these templates when creating CCTXs

2. Example structure:

### [basic.edn](file:///home/chip/Documents/cctx/templates/v1/transactors/basic.edn)

This approach gives us:
1. Version control over transactor code
2. Easy way to update from field experience
3. Multiple transactor templates for different use cases
4. Clear separation between template and implementation
5. Ability to evolve the transactor interface over time

When you find improvements in the field, you can:
1. Update the appropriate transactor template
2. Version control the changes
3. Builder automatically gets the improvements

Does this intermediate form help manage the evolution of the transactor code?

Do not take `cctx-model.edn` or `cctx_schema.clj` as well-considered structure. They are a beginning. I have attached a sample `cctx.clj` file that is a proof of concept. It too is a guide, not a final structure. I can imagine a builder using separate source files to build a cctx.

  :md "Hey again. I hope this finds you well.
  I've hit a spot in my work that brought your work to mind.
  I've finally grown out of no-/low-code and have a Clojure/Datomic-based project (back to solo full-stack). The codebase is significant enough (for very inexperienced me) to be experiencing change anxiety. I've caught myself wishing changes to my codebase could be done as transactions. Of course, git is required for survival. git, however, is about code management. I need something that helps with mental branching and committing.
  I'm starting a sub-project to support my primary work. I'm calling it cctx, short for \"codebase change transaction\". Thinking transactionally is helping.
  Why am I interrupting your busy life with this?
  Beyond your perpetual support—which has already meant so much—there are aspects of cctx that remind me of <confidential>.  Specifically, creating a new cctx is essentially creating a mini project. I will be learning from your work as I go.
  So…
  Thanks for listening and your support in general. It's nice to be able to touch base with someone I consider a pillar of a community that is so important to me.

  Of course, cctx could turn out to be just another bad idea. Frankly, the only thing worse than cctx is not having something like it. If you know of a facility that serves such a purpose, I'd appreciate the tip."

  Hi Chip! I saw you'd come back to being active in the community!
  I guess my first thought would be git branches, so you can work at will on a branch, and then either throw it away or merge it to the main branch -- the merge being the \"change transaction\" in my mind...
  ...but if you're more focused on creating \"scratch\" subprojects to explore ideas, I wonder if Polylith would help? Each new mini project would be a base in Polylith language, with a project if you need to actually \"build\" something from it. Polylith has the advantage that you can have a single REPL across the entire codebase and still treat each \"sub project\" independently (from a build/deploy) p.o.v.


  Chip
    12:30 PM
  :grinning:
  Yes, each cctx will reside in a git branch with the merge as the ultimate objective. I am working on language to specify a cctx.
  I have heard you speak well of Polylith in that past. I'm headed over there now to become better acquainted with its facility. Malli is also playing an early role.
  Between you and me, I hope I abandon this cctx thing. Shiny new things are a young man's fascination.
  Thanks again.
  The very best to you and yours.
