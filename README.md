# Codebase Change Transaction (CCTX)

I cannot chase code around all the time. I need to deal with changes in ways that don't rob me of all my time and concerns. Creating changes as transactions are what I'm trying to structure. If the transaction doesn't do as we want, we roll it back, just like every other transaction.

Maybe a CCTX is to programming what a branch is to code.
