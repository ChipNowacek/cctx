# Codebase Change Transaction (CCTX)

Bringing ACID to the coding experience.

I cannot chase code around all the time. I need to deal with changes to the codebase in ways that don't rob me of all my time and attention. 

Why can't changes to the codebase be like database transactions? If the transaction doesn't do as we want, we roll it back â€” just like every other transaction.

Maybe a CCTX is to programming what a branch is to code.

## Configuration

CCTX uses two main configuration files: `projects.edn` and template configuration files.

### Projects Configuration

The `projects.edn` file defines the projects that CCTX can work with. Example structure:

```edn
{:projects
 {"ProjectName"
  {:name "ProjectName"
   :project-root "/path/to/project"
   :dev-in-container? true
   :container-project-root "/container/path"  ; Optional, required if dev-in-container? is true
   :cctx-dir "dev/cctx"
   :cctxs-dir "dev/cctx/cctxs"
   :project-has-templates false
   :project-templates-dir "path/to/templates"}}}
```

Configuration fields:
- `name`: Project identifier
- `project-root`: Absolute path to project root on host system
- `dev-in-container?`: Whether development happens in a container
- `container-project-root`: Project path inside container (required if dev-in-container? is true)
- `cctx-dir`: Directory for CCTX infrastructure relative to project root
- `cctxs-dir`: Directory for individual CCTXs relative to project root
- `project-has-templates`: Whether project has its own CCTX templates
- `project-templates-dir`: Path to project-specific templates (if project-has-templates is true)

### Templates

CCTX templates are organized by version and define different types of changes. Basic template types include:

```edn
{:basic        ; Simple change with no predefined actions
 {:name "Basic Change"
  :desc "Simple change with no predefined actions"
  :spec {...}}
 
 :transformer  ; Change that transforms data with validation
 {:name "Transformer Change"
  :desc "Change that transforms data with validation"
  :spec {...}}
 
 :script       ; Adds executable script to dev/scripts
 {:name "Add Script"
  :desc "Adds a new executable script"
  :spec {...}}
 
 :bb-script    ; Adds Babashka script to dev/scripts
 {:name "Add Babashka Script"
  :desc "Adds a new Babashka script"
  :spec {...}}}
```

Each template defines:
- Name and description
- Change specification including:
  - Title and description
  - Change operations (add file, transform, etc.)
  - Requirements
  - Rollback and dry-run options

Templates are validated against a schema that ensures required fields and proper structure:

```edn
[:map-of :keyword
 [:map
  [:name string?]
  [:desc string?]
  [:spec [:map
          [:title string?]
          [:description string?]
          [:changes [:sequential ...]]
          [:requires {:optional true} [:sequential keyword?]]
          [:rollback {:optional true} boolean?]
          [:dry-run {:optional true} boolean?]]]]]
```
